# PruebaMedialab

This test is created with the intention of MVVM architecture, with dependency injection library Hilt, Room and as a Retrofit proposal if necessary.

In the first window you see a tab with two windows, one where you can see the list of users and the other where you can create or delete a user, delete according to mail only.

In the user list view you can click on any of them and get to the details window to edit them.

The only thing missing was to add upload or add a photo to the test.
